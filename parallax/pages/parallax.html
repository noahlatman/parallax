 <h2>Climate Change</h2>
 <p>
 Climate change is a big problem that happens when the earth's temperature gets warmer. This happens because of human activity, like burning fossil fuels and cutting down trees. When the earth gets warmer, it causes problems like stronger storms, rising sea levels, and hotter temperatures. This can hurt animals, people, and the environment. Climate change also affects things like food, water, and health. We need to do things like using clean energy and reducing waste to help slow down climate change and protect our planet.

 <h2>Pollution</h2>

 Pollution is a big problem that harms people, animals, and the environment. It happens when things like factories, cars, garbage, and farming hurt the air, water, soil, and noise around us. Pollution can make us sick and hurt the planet. It also makes climate change worse, which is a problem for everyone. We need to act fast to reduce pollution and protect the earth for the future.

 <h2>What We Must Do</h2>
 <p>
Preserving the earth and stopping climate change is crucial for the survival of our planet and all living beings. Climate change causes severe damage to ecosystems, affects food production, and worsens natural disasters. It also has long-term impacts on public health and the economy. We must take collective action to reduce our carbon footprint, conserve natural resources, and transition towards renewable energy sources. By preserving the earth, we can ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. It's our responsibility to take immediate action to mitigate climate change and protect our planet.
